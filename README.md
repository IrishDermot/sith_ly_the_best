Star Wars Memory Game
Introduction
We created this game as part of the Star Wars Hackathon in May 2023 in association with the Code Institute. We wanted to create a simple memory card similar to others in the market. Due to the time constraints and with some people in the team with only very limited or almost no coding knowledge, a simple game like a memory card game was going to be a more effective and efficient use of our time. Our team called Sith-ly The Best wanted to create a game that would be enjoyable, fun, rewarding and would attract repeat plays as well as being simple and straightforward, so anyone can play it. 
Providing users with a layout which is easy to understand and high quality.
