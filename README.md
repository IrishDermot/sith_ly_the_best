Star Wars Memory Game
Introduction
We created this game as part of the Star Wars Hackathon in May 2023 in association with the Code Institute. We wanted to create a simple memory card similar to others in the market. Due to the time constraints and with some people in the team with only very limited or almost no coding knowledge, a simple game like a memory card game was going to be a more effective and efficient use of our time. Our team called Sith-ly The Best wanted to create a game that would be enjoyable, fun, rewarding and would attract repeat plays as well as being simple and straightforward, so anyone can play it. 
Providing users with a layout which is easy to understand and high quality.

Conception

My thinking was that given the requirements of the project, it would be very beneficial to formulate some kind of plan which would lay out the basic scope and design of my project in order to have some kind of structure with which to work with in order to avoid missing any crucial steps during construction and make the whole construction process as efficient as possible.

I made use of the following resources in order to plan and visualise my project, Star Wars Memory Game:

-slack. With my fellow teammates we communicate on our dedicated slack team channel for our team called Sith-ly The Best. We communicate what tasks each of us should be performing and help each with any problems or issues and have huddles which are basically like team members where we can discuss in more depth all things in regards to our project. We suggest ideas on slack also.
-github. We use this platform to share a working space for our project to collaborate.
-code institue learning resources. Very helpful for things like being reminded of some coding language sequences
-youtube. Many tutorial videos on how to use things like GitHub and coding language issues
-general online help such as google for looking up issues
-Balsamiq in order to create a basic wireframe design 


Basic Wireframe Design

Once I had the basic scope and logic in place, I then proceeded to design a visual representation of what is needed for the basic functionality of the project from a user's point of view and how I would represent that.

Agile

I made use of agile common practises as described in the Code Institute tutorials. I did my best to come up with a complete layout of my agile plan from the get go but will make decisions in logical stages and update my diagrams and processes as the project develops, while documenting everything as the build progressed.

This is how I approached the challenge:

After reading the project requirements and the User's goal for the project idea that I had selected, I came up with the project's user goal, themes and epics.
From the epic's I derived the various user stories and built on this as the project developed.
Once I had created some user stories, I then came up with the relevant tasks for each user story.
After creating some stucture and scope for how to approach the task at hand, I started recording all my processes on Github:
I created user story templates on Github for efficiency in the Agile process.
I made use of Github issues to create and manage my user stories and for future defects if they arise.
I also came up with user story acceptance criteria which I added to the user stories as comments on Github issues.
I allocated each user story with user story points, just as good practice.
A product backlog was also created using Github milestones, and managed throughout the development of the project in order to structure my development process.
As the build developed I would make refinements to the backlog.
I also created an iteration milestones on Github projects for use in this project as a timebox.
I made use of MoSCow prioritization by creating labels on Github and allocating them to the relevant user stories.
I also tried to keep balance of 60% Must have's, 20% Should have's and 20% Could have's for each iteration.
I created a Kanban board for use as an information radiator in this project by using "projects" on Github.
