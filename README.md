Star Wars Memory Game
Introduction
We created this game as part of the Star Wars Hackathon in May 2023 in association with the Code Institute. We wanted to create a simple memory card similar to others in the market. Due to the time constraints and with some people in the team with only very limited or almost no coding knowledge, a simple game like a memory card game was going to be a more effective and efficient use of our time. Our team called Sith-ly The Best wanted to create a game that would be enjoyable, fun, rewarding and would attract repeat plays as well as being simple and straightforward, so anyone can play it.

Conception

My thinking was that given the requirements of the project, it would be very beneficial to formulate some kind of plan which would lay out the basic scope and design of my project in order to have some kind of structure with which to work with in order to avoid missing any crucial steps during construction and make the whole construction process as efficient as possible.

I made use of the following resources in order to plan and visualise my project, Star Wars Memory Game:

-slack. With my fellow teammates we communicate on our dedicated slack team channel for our team called Sith-ly The Best. We communicate what tasks each of us should be performing and help each with any problems or issues and have huddles which are basically like team members where we can discuss in more depth all things in regards to our project. We suggest ideas on slack also.
-github. We use this platform to share a working space for our project to collaborate.
-code institue learning resources. Very helpful for things like being reminded of some coding language sequences
-youtube. Many tutorial videos on how to use things like GitHub and coding language issues
-general online help such as google for looking up issues
